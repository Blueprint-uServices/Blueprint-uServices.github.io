description: Package timeouts provides a Blueprint modifier for the client side of service calls.The plugin configures clients with a timeout mechanism using contexts. The plugin will generate a wrapper client class that will wait for a fixed amount of time \(the specified timeout value\) before canceling the context. Once the context is cancelled, the execution returns to the caller.
