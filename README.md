# Blueprint

Blueprint is a microservice development toolchain that enables rapid Configure, Build, Deploy pattern for generating microservice applications. With just a few lines of code, users can easily reconfigure an applicationâ€™s design; Blueprint will then generate a fully-functioning variant of the application under the new design. Blueprint introduces flexible zero-cost abstractions for developing applications that enforce a strict separation of concerns between application-level logic, lower-level infrastructure components, and implementation and configuration choices. Blueprint is open-source and extensible; it supports a wide variety of reconfigurable design dimensions; and we have ported all major microservice benchmarks to it. Our evaluation demonstrates how Blueprint simplifies the three core use-cases with orders-of-magnitude less code change.
