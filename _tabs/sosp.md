## Tutorial on using Blueprint for accelerating Microservice Research

This tutorial at [SOSP 2024](https://sigops.org/s/conferences/sosp/2024/index.html) in Austin, Texas will provide a hands-on introduction on how systems researchers can leverage and use Blueprint to accelerate their microservice research.

We will use metastability failures in microservice systems as a case-study throughout the tutorial, and demonstrate how to reproduce these failures with Blueprint.

### Tutorial at a Glance

The tutorial will be held on 3rd November, 2024 in Room 616A.
